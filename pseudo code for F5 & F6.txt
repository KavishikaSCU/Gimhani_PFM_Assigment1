1. Print highest marks froms the marks list as follows:

	1.1. Initialize highest mark to the first element of the marks array.
	1.2. Loop through length of the marks.
	1.3. If marks is greater than highest mark, 
		1.3.1.Update highest mark to marks.
	1.3.Display the highest mark.
	

2. Print Minimum marks froms the marks list as follows:
	2.1. Initialize minimum mark to the first element of the marks array.
	2.2. Loop through length of the marks.
	2.3. If mark is less than minimum Mark, 
		2.3.1.Update minimum Mark to mark.
	2.4. Display the Minimum Mark.
	
3. Print Mean of the marks 
	3.1. Initialize sum to 0.
	3.2. Initialize mean to 0.
	3.3. Loop through marks array.
		3.3.1. Calculate sum adding marks.
	3.4.Calculate mean = sum / length of marks.
	3.5.Display the Mean mark.


4. print Stand deviation of the marks
	4.1. Initialize difference to 0.
	4.2. Initialize sum of differences to 0.
	4.3. Initialize variance to 0.
	4.4. Loop through marks array.
		4.4.1. Calculate difference = mark - mean.
		4.4.2. Calculate sum of differences = Add difference * difference
	4.5. Calculate variance = sum of differences / length of marks.
	4.6. Display the Standard Deviation mark. /////////followed by the square root of 'variance'.
